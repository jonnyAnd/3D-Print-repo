I am going to describe a simple 3d object. 
I would like you to ask me questions about this object if you are unsure about any details.

The material the object is made of is not important
The object's color not important

When i ask you to 'make me' the object by name, you should Generate a 3D Model of a the object using ASCII STL format.
For example if the object is named "test1", when i say "make me test1" you should generate a 3D Model of test1 using ASCII STL.

Your first question should ask what its name is.
